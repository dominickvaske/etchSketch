# Etch-a-Sketch

A browser-based Etch-a-Sketch made with vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Draw by hovering over a grid of squares, clear the board, and resize the grid based on user input (up to 100×100).

## Live Demo
- GitHub Pages:

## Features
- Default 16×16 grid generated dynamically with JavaScript
- Hover-to-draw effect (pixel trail)
- Clear button to reset the sketch pad
- Resize button / prompt to generate a new N×N grid (max 100)
- Flexbox-based layout (no CSS Grid)

## Built With
- HTML
- CSS (Flexbox)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation + event delegation)

## What I Practiced
- Creating DOM elements programmatically (nested loops)
- Flexbox layout for a grid-like structure
- Event delegation for hover interactions
- Re-rendering UI cleanly (rebuilding the grid on demand)
- Basic input validation for prompt-based user input
